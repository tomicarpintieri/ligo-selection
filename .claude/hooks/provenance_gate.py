"""Stop hook: work that produced a figure or a number must leave a record.

Fires at the moment the agent decides it is finished and is about to hand back
to the user (Claude Code `Stop`; Codex `Stop`, "right before Codex ends its
turn"). A non-zero exit puts the message on stderr into the conversation as a
new turn, so the agent is not finished after all.

THE SHAPE OF THIS TOOL, which is the general part:

    the convention lives in .md files, once
    the skill points at them, so a fresh session follows it from the start
    the hook checks the result, and on failure serves the .md that applies

Nothing here restates the format. The gate knows which checks failed; each
check names the file that says what to write; the hook prints those files and
nothing else. Add a check, write its .md, and both delivery routes get it.

In a long run the agent may never load the skill. The hook runs whether or not
it did, and that is what it is for.

ONE SCRIPT, TWO WIRINGS. `.claude/settings.json` runs it for Claude Code and
`.codex/hooks.json` runs it for Codex, at the same two events:

    SessionStart   `--start`: note the time. Anything already in the tree at
                   that moment was handed to the agent, not produced by it —
                   the paper the task points at is a .pdf and must not be
                   mistaken for a result.
    Stop           the check.

# LOCAL PATCH (ligo-selection, 2026-09-11). Two changes to the course original:
#
#   1. Windows path separators. glob() returns backslashes here, so the upstream
#      substring tests ("/.claude/" in p) never matched and the scaffold's own
#      directories were scanned as if they held results.
#   2. Scope. Walking the whole tree included .venv/, which is ~30 000 files of
#      site-packages -- matplotlib alone ships sample .png files there -- and it
#      was walked on every Stop. The scan has to stop at what is not our work.
#
# The convention did not change; only which paths are looked at.
